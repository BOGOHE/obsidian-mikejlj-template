# Obsidian template

A template of my Obsidian setup. Inspired by some great prior art  from:

* [laozhou-in-germany](https://github.com/laozhou-in-germany/Chens_LMS_Public/blob/main/LICENSE)
* [EliWimmer](https://github.com/EliWimmer/Obsmd-Life-Manager)

Some documentation for specific parts is available in [[docs|the docs folder]].

This repo is very tailored to how I want to work, but feel free to copy and edit it and make it your own. Hopefully it's a good starting point, or some good inspiration for your own vaults.
